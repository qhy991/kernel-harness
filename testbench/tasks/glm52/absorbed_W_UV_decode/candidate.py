"""GLM-5.2 Absorbed W_UV BMM (decode) — the one file to edit for this task.

Run `./run.sh --describe` for the full contract. The short version:

`inputs` is the frozen dict from glm52_ops.build_inputs. The very same dict feeds
the reference, so do NOT re-quantize, re-seed, or rebuild any tensor inside
run() — that would measure a different problem than the one the gate checked.

Tensors at M=16:

    A_fp8            (64, 16, 512)            torch.float8_e4m3fn
    B_fp8            (64, 512, 256)           torch.float8_e4m3fn
    A_scale          (1,)                     torch.float32
    B_scale          (1,)                     torch.float32

Return the output. Correctness is cosine >= 0.99 AND
rel_l2 <= 0.141421 against glm52_ops.reference on these inputs;
cosine alone is scale-blind, so both gate.

Baseline to beat: the call below, timed CUPTI cold-L2 on these same inputs.
